## Alexander Lin's Portfolio

This is essentially where I show off all the code projects that simply can't be printed on a resume.

### Games

I've made quite a few games during my time in Uni and HS, and most of them are made in Unity: Here are a few:


# Ants vs Some Bees
A tower defense game which is definitely not inspired by a game featuring botanical lifeforms and the undead.

# Roller Madness
A game inovlving collecting coins with a rolling ball while avoiding falling bricks. Developed in Unity.
# Box Shooter
A game involving collecting coins with a gun, while avoiding bad coins. Also Developed in Unity.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AlexLin1234/Portfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
